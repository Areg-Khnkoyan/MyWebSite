    SDG 8 promotes inclusive and sustainable economic growth,
    productive employment and decent work for all.
    Over the past decade, progress on Goal 8 has been mixed. While there have been important gains, in particular in reducing unemployment and expanding financial access, setbacks from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and ongoing structural challenges have slowed or reversed gains in productivity, employment and worker protections – in particular for vulnerable groups and in the least developed countries and small island developing States. Just transitions to the formal sector –especially for women and youth – supported by stronger links to social protection systems, are essential to ensure sustainable livelihoods and reduce inequalities. Accelerated action is needed to build more inclusive, productive and resilient labour markets, strengthen protections for informal and migrant workers and advance green and digital economy initiatives that promote decent work. To support faster progress, the Secretary-General launched the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions, which supports the expansion and consolidation of social protection systems and the creation of decent work opportunities. Another key effort is the United Nations initiative on the key transition relating to jobs and social protection, which helps governments to link employment and social protection policies to national development plans.
